    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 2026-02-04</p>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how <strong>Translate PDF: Keep Layout</strong> (the "App") handles your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide our services and manage your trial points, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> We collect non-personally identifiable unique device identifiers (such as IDFV) or a randomly generated User ID. This is used solely to manage your trial credits, limit usage (3 trials per user), and prevent abuse of the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information on how you interact with the app, such as the number of translations performed and successful file exports, to improve our service performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Processing of PDF Files and Content</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Translation Processing:</strong> When you use the translation feature, the text and images extracted from your PDF documents are sent to our secure backend and processed via the <strong>Deepseek API</strong> for translation and OCR purposes.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Your document content is processed temporarily for the sole purpose of generating your translated files. We do not store your original or translated documents on our servers longer than necessary to complete the download. We do not use your data to train AI models or for any marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Files/Document Storage:</strong> To select PDF documents for translation and save the output PowerPoint or Word files.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To allow you to select background images or image-based PDFs for OCR and translation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App utilizes third-party service providers (such as Deepseek) to perform text translation. These third parties handle your data in accordance with their own privacy policies and are prohibited from using the data for any other purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. In-App Purchases and Credits</h2>
    <p>If you choose to purchase additional credits or full version access, all financial transactions are processed securely by Apple. We do not collect or store your credit card or bank account information.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
